<h1>Landmass Generator</h1>
An academic project that I added more to. This project randomly generates landmasses and using those values, we're able to create a map. There are multiple ways to printing out the map: console, text file, and bitmap. 

I'd like to use this code, or these concepts, in future game projects where I need a randomly generated map.
